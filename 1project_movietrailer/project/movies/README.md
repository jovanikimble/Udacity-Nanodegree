# Movie Trailer Website

This program will open a website on the browser
with all of my favorite movies and their trailers.
To access the trailers, the user needs to click on the movie poster images.

## Motivation

The reason this website was created was to show and demonstrate understanding of using **classes** in **python** and comfortability using third party code **(fresh_tomatoes.py)**.

## Code Example

Using classes
```
  def __init__(self, movie_title, movie_storyline,
               poster_image, trailer_youtube):

    self.title = movie_title
    self.storyline = movie_storyline
    self.poster_image_url = poster_image
    self.trailer_youtube_url = trailer_youtube
```
Using third party code

`import fresh_tomatoes`

##Installation

Make sure you have **python downloaded and installed.**
