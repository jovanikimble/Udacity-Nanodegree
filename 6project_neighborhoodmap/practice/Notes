Intro to AJAX:

- Internet = people sending messages back and forth
- Client - Internet - Server
- Client sends a get request to server
- Internet passes the messages along
- Server sends a response back.

When browsers make a request without AJAX it has to wait for the page to load.

- AJAX allows for ascynchronous behavior happening in the backgroung without waiting for the page to load

- AJAX = Asynchronuous Javascript and XML request - allow for content retrieval and display without reloading the webpage - requests do not block other events from happening.
- AJAX = Asynchronuous Javascript and JSON request
 - Html is often embedded within AJAX request

 - An asynchronous request can be fired off at any time and is often the respoonse is HTML to be inserted dynamically into the page.
