CLients and Servers:
  - computers communicating over the internet.
  - client - wants info (initiates)
  - server - has info

  - protocols make sure all machines are communicating in the same way
    - [Transmission Control Protocol] TCP (broken into small packets)
      - [User Datagram Protocol] UDP - TCP's counterpart and good for streaming

    - [Internet Protocol] IP (similar to postal addresses, every device has one, allowsmessages to be properly routed, uses ip address found in dns to initiate communication with server for that web app)
      - os's use ports to designate channels of commuanication on the same ip address.
      - colon after ip address with another number(ie. 8080) indicates that we want to communicate on a specific port on a device using that ip address

    Fun Fact: localhost ip address = 127.0.0.1 (when client and server on same machine)

    - [] HTTP (clients tell servers what they want by using an HTTP verb or an http method, there are 9 http verbs. Get and Post are most common)
      - GET(safe method), wants info from server
      - POST, wants to modify info on server
      - Servers respond to reuest with status codes. Examples:
        200: Successful GET
        301: Successful POST
        404: File not found
