CREATE READ UPDATE DELETE

SQL is the popular language for communicating with/ talking to databases.

ORM, Object Relational Mapping:
  - can be thought of as a translator
  - Example python object translated by the ORM as an SQL statement

SQLAlchemy
  - allows us to write a single python file to setup and configure our database.
  - 4 major coding components.
    - Configuaration code: import necessary modules
      - generally does not change from project to project
      - imports all modules needed
      - creates instance of declaritive base
      - at end of file creates or connects the database and adds tables and columns.
    - Class code: used to import or data in python
      - representation of table as a python class
      - extends the Base class
      - nested inside will be table and mapper code
    - Table code: represents specific table in our datbase
    - Mapper code: connects the columns of our table to the
    class that represents it.
      - creates variables that we will use to create columns
      within our database
      - when we create a column we must also pass in attributes, examples:
        - String(250) (Specified maximum length)
        - Integer
        - relationship(Class)
        - nullable = False
        - primary_key = True
        - ForeignKey('some_table_id')
    UPDATE:
      1. Find entry
      2. Resett values
      3. Add to session
      4. session.commit()
    DELETE:
      1. Find entry
      2. session.delete(entry)
      3. session.commut()
